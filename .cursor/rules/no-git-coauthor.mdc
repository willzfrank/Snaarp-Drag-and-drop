# Git and commits

- Do not run any git commands (clone, commit, push, pull, rebase, amend, etc.). The user will handle all version control.
- Do not add "Co-authored-by" or any Cursor/cursoragent attribution to commit messages. If the user asks you to prepare a commit message, provide plain text only with no co-author trailers.
